# Lifestyle Deep Profiling Using Wearable Biosensors and Glucose Control Prediction 


We profiles cohort with wearables and keep the record regarding diet, sleep, and activities. Based on the lifestype profling, we search for type 2 diabetes related features and classify different subtypes. The paper will be submitted soon.

The analysis is separated into three parts: 

1. Statistics analysis of each feature groups (code|data)
2. Targetted analysis of sleep and activity related features (code|data)
3. Integrated model for classifying pathophysiologic classes (code|data)
