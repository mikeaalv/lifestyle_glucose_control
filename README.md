# High-resolution lifestyle profiling and metabolic subphenotypes of type 2 diabetes


This study integrates high-resolution lifestyle data (diet, sleep, and physical activity) from wearable devices, continuous glucose monitoring, and smartphone-based food logs with gold-standard physiological tests in individuals at risk for T2D. Metabolic subphenotypes include beta-cell function, tissue-specific insulin resistance (muscle, liver, adipose tissue), and incretin function.

The analysis consists of three parts: 

1. Statistics analysis of each feature groups (code|data)
2. Targetted analysis of sleep and activity related features (code|data)
3. Integrated model for classifying pathophysiologic classes (code|data)
